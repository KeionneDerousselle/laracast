## The Laracast PHP Practitioner Course - [Laracast Course Link](https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners)

This repository has my solutions for the above online course.
The code is a guideline if you get study throughout the course.
I have created some additional, but simple new features to make the UI a bit better and more understable.

- One folder per each course episode.

- Alternative ways to some exercises like [this](/4-%20PHP%20and%20HTML/index.php) example.

- Each folder ready for visualization.

_Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. 
It allows you to download and update all dependent libraries for this project.
The vendor folder will be generated when you run the Composer in the root of your project folder. When you execute the step 3, this folder will be downloaded to your work directory._


[This](https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners/episodes/21) this is the related lesson.
