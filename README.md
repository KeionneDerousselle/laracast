The code was organized as the same order of the course:

* Step 1 - Get PHP Installed
So you've decided to become a web developer? Excellent, excellent choice. At this point, you have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, and are now ready to take the next step. Right? Great! Let's learn PHP from the ground up.

Step 1 Homework: Get PHP 7, the latest version at the time of this recording, installed on your machine using one of the methods outlined above. You might use Homebrew on the Mac, or possibly MAMP, WAMP, or XAMPP. Any of these options will do just fine. To confirm that you've completed the homework, open the command line, and run php -v. Does it say PHP 7? Congrats!

* Step 2 - Install a Proper Code Editor
Before we get started, let's ensure that you have a proper code editor installed on your machine. As you'll find, code editors are much like fashion: everyone has their own preference. It doesn't matter which you choose, so pick one!

Step 2 Homework: Install a proper code editor on your machine right now. It could be Sublime Text, Atom, PHPStorm, or a different one entirely.

* Part 3 - Variable
Now that you're ready to begin coding, let's start at the top. What exactly is a variable, and why would you ever use or need one?

Step 3 Homework: Create a variable, and figure out how to echo it onto the screen or page.
